# Index Performance Analysis

## Current Performance (Before Adding Custom Indexes)

### 1. User Authentication Query
- Execution Time: 7.307 ms
- Query Plan: Index Scan using "User_email_key" (automatic unique index)
- Index Used: Yes (automatic)

### 2. Property Booking Query
- Execution Time: 711.204 ms (very slow)
- Query Plan: Nested Loop with Seq Scan on Property (no index on host_id)
- Problem Areas:
  - Sequential scan on Property table
  - High execution time

### 3. Property Search Query
- Execution Time: 7.741 ms
- Query Plan: Seq Scan on Property (no index on location)
- Problem Areas:
  - Sequential scan
  - LIKE operation without index

## Performance Comparison: Before vs After Indexing

### User Authentication Query
| Metric         | Before  | After   | Change       |
|----------------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Execution Time | 7.307 ms| 4.187 ms| 42.7% faster |

### Property Booking Query
| Metric         | Before    | After    | Change       |
|----------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Execution Time | 711.204 ms| 11.799 ms| 98.3% faster |

### Property Search Query
| Metric         | Before  | After    | Change       |
|----------------|---------|----------|--------------|
| Execution Time | 7.741 ms| 9.801 ms | -26.6% slower|

## Analysis and Recommendations

1. Excellent Improvement in property booking query:
   - From 711ms to ~12ms (98% faster)
   - The index on `host_id` is working effectively

2. Slight Degradation in property search query:
   - This is unexpected and suggests we need to optimize further
   - Consider using a trigram index for better LIKE performance

3. User authentication continues to perform well:
   - 42.7% improvement from indexing
   - Already using automatic index effectively

## Next Steps

1. Optimize property search with specialized index:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
   CREATE INDEX idx_property_location_trgm ON Property USING gin(location gin_trgm_ops);
